/**
 * Commonly found 28BYJ-48 stepper motor. Typically driven by a ULN2003 driver chip. The default frequency is for a
 * freely-running motor with no load.
 * <p>
 * Datasheet - https://components101.com/sites/default/files/component_datasheet/28byj48-step-motor-datasheet.pdf
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>here are apparently two variations with different gear ratios - the default is for the 16:1</li>
 *     <li>motion is "smoother" when the controller is in "half-step" mode, but torque will be variable</li>
 * </ul>
