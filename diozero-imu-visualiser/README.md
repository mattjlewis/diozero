# 3D IMU Orientation Visualiser
Please download the object "[SpaceLaunchSystem.3DS](http://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/detail/sls-block1-3ds)" and place in /src/main/resources/models. Alternatively replace with any other supported model type and update [MqttListener](https://github.com/mattjlewis/diozero/blob/master/diozero-imu-visualiser/src/main/java/com/diozero/imu/mqtt/MqttListener.java) accordingly.
Note this is a demo sample application and I'm not yet 100% convinced the axis are correct.
